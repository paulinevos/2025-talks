## Orchestrating Mobility with Symfony — Smooth Ride Guaranteed! 🚕

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>How can you fairly distribute thousands of taxi rides each month while respecting complex business rules and ensuring both performance and scalability? That’s the challenge we tackled with Winbook, our ride allocation engine built entirely in PHP with Symfony.

In this talk, I’ll take you behind the scenes of this production system, which handles a significant and growing volume of rides. We’ll explore how we leveraged Symfony components like Scheduler, Messenger, Notifier, and API Platform to build a robust, responsive, and scalable architecture.

We’ll cover:
* The business rules that drive ride allocation (such as local taxi licenses, driver behavior, etc.)
* The algorithmic choices made to ensure fairness and efficiency
* The technical challenges of implementing a real-time engine in PHP

This talk is for anyone who believes PHP can be both powerful and performant — and who enjoys seeing real-world code solving real-world problems.</dd>

## Developing the developer: Journaling with AI

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In order to be able to show growth and improve myself as a developer and coworker, I need a system. Previous attempts at journaling failed, but with the rise of LLM and AI, there is a new option.

In this talk, I explain my journaling system, how it works for me, and how you can use the open sourced template to make it your own.

This is for developers: it is not an app, nor a SaaS. It's something you can use within your own IDE, with your own workflow, and your own modifications.</dd>

## Strategic DDD

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Domain Driven Design focuses on modelling the domain logic and helps us to map the business requirements to our software. We'll discuss the terminology and take a look at what Domain Driven Design is and see how you use it to make software that meets the needs of its users. Most people seem to concentrate on the tactical patterns in DDD, but the strategic side is where the most benefit can be found. I will concentrate on the on these strategic considerations, particularly the importance of communication at all levels of the project so that by the end of this session you will be better positioned to create excellent, maintainable applications.</dd>

## Distributed Transactions in Symfony

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In microservice or event-driven architectures you might find yourself having to solve issues which are simple when working with monolithic applications. One of these challenges is distributed transactions, i.e., performing an action across multiple services can be safely reversed when something fails along the call chain. The Saga pattern is an established approach to make this happen. Let's have a look at what it is, how we can implement it in a modern Symfony application and when we might want to avoid it.</dd>

## ClickHouse for Symfony developers

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>While most PHP applications rely on traditional row-oriented databases, many modern applications require processing massive amounts of data for analytics, logging, and metrics – areas where conventional databases struggle. This becomes even more apparent when you need real-time performance at scale.

ClickHouse is a powerful column-oriented database that can save you significant time when aggregating data in real-time, all without leaving the comfort of your technology stack.

In this talk we'll explore :
- Why column-oriented databases are game-changers for analytical workloads
- How to integrate ClickHouse with Symfony applications using recommended practices
- Real-world architecture patterns that effectively combine traditional databases with ClickHouse
- How to deploy ClickHouse with just a few lines of code
- Key ClickHouse features for building real-time dashboards
- Concrete aggregation examples with benchmarks comparing ClickHouse to other solutions

We'll also cover advanced features like cold storage, replication, and practical optimization tricks learned from production experience.

Whether you're working with e-commerce applications, logs, user events, IoT data, or business metrics, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to implement ClickHouse as a powerful addition to your PHP development toolkit.</dd>

## Kill the SPA!

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Are React, Vue, or even Hotwired still essential for creating modern websites and web applications?
New web projects, even those built using Symfony, tend to be systematically written as Single Page Apps. As a result, they contain a lot of JavaScript code, which often makes them unnecessarily slow and difficult to maintain. Their search engine optimization and indexing by robots powering AI chats can also be greatly degraded.

Thanks to modern CSS, however, the situation has changed: View Transitions and Speculation Rules now make it possible to achieve a UX and a perception of fluidity similar to that offered by the best SPAs, but using a “traditional” approach, without the need for JavaScript or the complexity it introduces.
In concrete terms, this means that it is once again possible to use our favorite framework and its companion Twig for what they excel at: generating server-side HTML, while maintaining excellent UI and UX quality.

During this talk, I will present the architecture of a modern Symfony application that does not depend (or depends very little) on JavaScript and is not an SPA. Then I will introduce a new Symfony UX component that takes advantage of this architecture, the Mercure protocol, and FrankenPHP to offer a feature prized by front-end developers: automatic reloading of views (while preserving states) during development.</dd>

## Search with Meilisearch, with some AI

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In this fast-paced talk, we'll walk through a complete life-cycle of working with a set of data, starting with a CSV file and ending with an AI-powered semantic search that's fast and beautiful.

To do this, we'll use Meilisearch, the same open source search engine that po
wers Symfony documentation. Meilisearch has recently added the ability to store vectors, making it easy to start with integrating AI into your application.

Symfony has some excellent tools for working with the data. We'll walk through them, starting with "symfony new --webapp my app" and then composer require a bunch of time-saving tools for Radid Application Development

* create an entity (make:entity -a)
* configure a console command (survos:make:command app:load)
* implement the load command, using CsvReader and ObjectMapper
* configure the api resource by tweaking some entity attributes so we'll have a readonly API endpoint
* make:admin:entity and make:admin:dashboard to create a way to view the imported data using EasyAdmin
* add some more entity attributes and create and configure a meili index
* import the data from doctrine to meilisearch
* configure a twig viewer (that renders in javascript!)

At this point we have a fast, powerful full-text search and filtering system that will be the envy of your peers. But there's more!

We'll setup an OpenAI account so we can create semantic vectors and store them, and add an embedder to meilisearch settings, and suddenly we have ai-powered semantic searcher.

Amazing, all of this happens with very few LOC (Lines of Code). Knowing what tools are available and how to configure them makes this possible, and the purpose of this talk is to demonstrate.</dd>

## Rubber Duck Driven Dev: Use MCPs to Develop and Deploy Safely

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Talk to the duck, ship real features. See how to turn clear prompts into branch creation, database queries, a new revenue card and API endpoint, gated pushes and merges, and even backup and restore. Reproducible, auditable, Symfony-ready. No vibes. Just controlled automation that gets work done.

AI should feel like a power tool, not a vibe. In this live demo we use an AI assistant to perform real, auditable development tasks while the developer stays in control. We will query project details, inspect PostgreSQL for total revenue, fetch environment URLs, take a backup, create a feature branch called revenue-card, generate a React dashboard card plus a matching API endpoint, commit and push to the remote, then merge to main. Finally, we will restore from backup to prove reversibility. Every step is driven by structured prompts that engage Upun's MCP server, versioned in Git, validated in production-grade preview environments on Upsun, and observable end to end. You will leave with a clear mental model and practical patterns for using conversational control to accelerate Symfony work without sacrificing standards, security, or sanity.</dd>

## Make your AI useful with MCP

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Wouldn't it be great if we can use our LLM to answer very specific questions? Wouldn't it be great to move away from a general purpose machine to something tailor made for me or my users? If we could stop asking questions like "What is the area of a sphere?" and more like:

- "What is the status on my last order?"
- "What are the total fees given to a supplier X?"
- "How many images have I uploaded this year?"

This talk will go over the MCP protocol, why we care and how to use it to create an AI service that is helpful.</dd>

## Rediscover the Console

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Console is one of the most widely used Symfony components and ranks among the top 5 most downloaded PHP packages worldwide.

Used by essential tools such as Composer, PHPStan, and Psalm, as well as by most PHP frameworks, CMS, e-commerce platforms, and ultimately our end applications, the console is ubiquitous.

The more a package is used, the more difficult it is to evolve. The slightest bug fix on the Console can disrupt millions of users. Nevertheless, the component has been constantly improved thanks to the countless contributions it has received since its introduction in 2010, while remaining true to its promise of backward compatibility.

But it's time to give the Console a major facelift, not only to get rid of some limitations and other design issues, but also to open it up to new possibilities.
That's why a few key contributors have been working hard to redesign it.

It's available since Symfony 7.3, and will get even better in a future version.
Join me to rediscover the Console!</dd>

## The Double-Edged Sword of Code Quality Tools

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In our pursuit of delivering high-quality code, we increasingly rely on automated tools like PHPUnit, PHPStan, Code-Fixer, Deptrac, and most recently AI. While following the best practices established by these tools' creators is valuable, there's a fine line between effective usage and overreliance. Drawing from our experience as a software vendor, I'll share real-world challenges we face in managing code quality tools. Through practical examples, I'll demonstrate situations where these tools can become counterproductive and present strategies for finding the right balance. Join me in examining whether our dedication to automated quality control might sometimes do more harm than good. Let's retrospect and answer the following question: are WE actually the sharpest (quality) tool in the shed?</dd>
